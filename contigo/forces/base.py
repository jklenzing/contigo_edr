"""Force model protocol that all forces must follow.

Simplifies and standardizes the inteface for all forces. This allows easy accees and 
easy addition of new forces to the EDR and EFD calculations.

Wrappers can be written to convert existing force models to this protocol, 
and new force models can be written to follow this protocol from the start.
